  Collective Shout describes itself as “a grassroots campaign movement against the objectification of women and sexualisation of girls in media, advertising and popular culture.”  Since its founding in 2010, it has claimed victories such as:
  <ul>
    <li>Removal of billboards judged to objectify women;</li>
    <li>Withdrawal of sexualised children’s clothing from retail;</li>
    <li>Bans on games featuring sexually violent content;</li>
    <li>Removal of Andrew Tate’s courses from Spotify;</li>
    <li>Initiation of an age‑verification trial for online pornographic websites.</li>
  </ul>

  Starting July 2025, Collective Shout coordinated campaigns urging payment processors (Visa, Mastercard, PayPal) to threaten de‑banking of platforms hosting NSFW games.  Valve subsequently removed dozens of adult‑themed titles from Steam, and itch.io “deindexed” over 21,000 NSFW listings in order to retain payment‑processor compliance. <red-flag>This action has been characterized by many developers as censorship enacted via financial pressure rather than transparent content policy enforcement.</red-flag>

  Affected creators have reported loss of revenue and lack of notice before delisting.  Digital‑rights advocates warn of a “chilling effect” on creative freedom when non‑legal actors leverage financial intermediaries to enforce moral standards.

  Collective Shout maintains that its approach is necessary to protect children and to challenge the “normalisation of sexual violence.”  It argues that traditional content‑moderation has failed to prevent exploitative material from reaching minors.

  Critics question whether payment‑processor pressure constitutes de facto editorial control, and call for clearer, platform‑driven policies rather than third‑party coercion.  Some platforms have since announced plans to publish detailed NSFW‑content guidelines and appeal processes.
