<red-flag>PySDL was a direct wrapper around the SDL C library. It was fairly low-level, meaning you had to work with SDL functions almost the same way you would in C, just through Python. That made it powerful but also clunky for Python developers. the earliest mention is the SourceForge project registration for PySDL on March 29, 2000 https://sourceforge.net/projects/pysdl/</red-flag>
