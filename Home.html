Compendium is a platform I built here on GitHub to serve as a direct, modern alternative to Wikipedia.
<br>
<br>
After working on Indiegamenews, I realized that the slow pace of publishing sometimes taking months to roll out a single article limited the impact I could make.
<br>
So I wanted to build something more dynamic and inclusive, especially for topics and communities that are often overlooked.
<br><br>
Wikipedia has some very major problems.
<br><br>
Primary sources are often discouraged in favor of their notorious notability rules, via secondary media coverage.
<br><br>
Nuanced or emerging topics can get suppressed because they lack traditional third-party coverage, and the lines between editorializing and summarizing become blurred.
<br><br>
By color-coding sources based on their proximity to the subject, we mitigate these aforementioned problems. This adds transparency to how knowledge is constructed without excluding large amounts of information.
<br><br>
by lowering the barrier for underrepresented subjects that are ignored due to this threshold Compendium attempts to be a much more modernized academic resource that more people will be able to fully utilize.
<br><br><br>
When writing articles for Compendium there are things to be mindful of. you should always maintain a neutral tone and lean away from opinionated content. You will also have to use the custom tagging
</p>

<strong style="margin: 1rem 2rem;">You can see how below:</strong>
<p style="margin: 1rem 2rem;">This is normal text in white. It is the fundamental tag your articles will be built around.</p>

<red-flag><p style="margin: 1rem 2rem;">
  &lt;red-flag&gt; the red-flag tag should be used to ask for verification of information, or to inform the reader that information may be outdated or inaccurate, or require clarification.</a>&lt;/red-flag&gt;
</p></red-flag>
<br><p></p>
<potential-illegality><p style="margin: 1rem 2rem;">
  &lt;potential-illegality&gt; the potential-illegality tag should only ever be used to warn against severe misconduct so that other people may take action and prevent harm, for example illegal explicit activities, or botnetting behaviours.&lt;/potential-illegality&gt;
</p></potential-illegality>
<br>
<p style="margin: 1rem 2rem;">these can be wrapped around any of the tags.</p>

<FirstHandAccount>
  &lt;FirstHandAccount&gt; The FirstHandAccount tag should be used for first hand sources. <a href="https://example.com/first">example link</a>.&lt;/FirstHandAccount&gt;
</FirstHandAccount>

<SecondHandAccount>
  &lt;SecondHandAccount&gt; The SecondHandAccount tag should be used for second hand sources. <a href="https://example.com/second">example link</a>.&lt;/SecondHandAccount&gt;
</SecondHandAccount>

<ThirdHandAccount>
  &lt;ThirdHandAccount&gt; The ThirdHandAccount tag should be used for third hand sources. <a href="https://example.com/third">example link</a>.&lt;/ThirdHandAccount&gt;
</ThirdHandAccount>
