<FirstHandAccount>Seboops <red-flag>(aka Stropus)</red-flag> is a solo indie developer active since December 2021, best known for two games, "Roll It!" and "Pop the Tick!". https://seboops.itch.io</FirstHandAccount>

<p style="margin: 1rem 2rem;">Notable Works:</p>

<FirstHandAccount>**Roll It!** – A challenging physics platformer in which the player rolls, slams, and dodges through obstacle-filled levels; features timed slams, unlockable skins, and eleven stages.  
  <red-flag>Active development appears to have ceased as of early 2023; no public builds beyond the browser demo have been released. However, there exists a <red-flag>very barebones</red-flag> prototype of a reboot, which is comprised only of a low-feature level editor.</red-flag>

<FirstHandAccount>**Pop the Tick!** – An action-puzzle game centered on “tick” popping with resource management via a “Lemon Meter”. Players must pop an onslaught of various ticks with a variety of different weapons, such as a needle, hammer, and flamethrower. 
Recent updates include a settings menu, quick weapon switching, and balance adjustments to the shop. Actively updated with quality-of-life improvements.

<FirstHandAccount>**RollIt Launchpad Light** – A free asset pack providing animated launchpad sprites with transparent backgrounds, licensed for commercial use and suitable for physics-based projects. It's an old sprite from his earlier days of pixel art, outdated compared to his modern artwork. https://seboops.itch.io/rollit-launchpad-light</FirstHandAccount>
