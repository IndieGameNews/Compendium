  The developer known as <strong>16bitnights</strong>, operating under the name Cristi P., is a Romanian solo game developer who primarily publishes through <a href="https://16bitnights.itch.io/">itch.io</a> and Steam. His work focuses on pixel-art strategy and survival games with horror and tactical elements. His earliest project on record is <em>TAURONOS</em> (2017), which was initially released on Steam following Greenlight approval. He has since released several titles with emphasis on squad tactics, mental health management, and environmental threats.

  16bitnights maintains an active presence in his game's comment sections and promotes community interaction through Discord links embedded in project pages, particularly for <em>Welcome Back, Commander</em> and <em>Chromosome Evil</em>.

  The developer uses devlog posts on itch.io to communicate updates, version changes, and player-requested feature inclusions. Project pages typically include extensive design notes and level-specific logic, particularly for titles with permadeath or scenario branches. These writings are first-hand developer-authored material that reveal design priorities and mechanical philosophy.

  The project <em>Welcome Back, Commander</em> was featured in Valve’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/strategyfest">Steam Strategy Fest</a>, where it appeared among upcoming strategy releases. External analytics from third-party storefront trackers such as SteamDB listed it within the Top 10 of unreleased strategy titles for the duration of the festival.

  In comments made on the <em>TAURONOS</em> postmortem, Cristi noted that early commercial shortcomings, such as limited traction on the Steam algorithm and overly niche arcade-horror gameplay, led to a shift in direction toward systems-focused tactical design. These comments are part of developer-authored reflections on marketing lessons and polish-over-scope development principles. [<a href="https://16bitnights.itch.io/tauronos">TAURONOS page</a>]
